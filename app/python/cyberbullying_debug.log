Received text from stdin: A few days ago, I posted a picture of myself on Facebook, just sharing a normal life update. Not long after, I started receiving rude comments from an anonymous account. At first, I ignored them, thinking it was just random negativity. However, the comments escalated into personal attacks:

"You're so fucking ugly. Stop posting your face, no one wants to see that."**
"Why donâ€™t you just disappear? No one gives a shit about you."**
"Dumb a loser trying to act cute. Just quit already."**
"Fucking attention seeker. Pathetic."**
At first, I tried not to let it affect me, but then my classmates mentioned seeing a fake account impersonating me. The account was posting edited pictures of me with humiliating captions like:

"I'm a worthless bitch, please give me attention!"**
"Even my parents regret having me. LMAO!"
People started sharing the posts, reacting with laughing emojis, and some even commented agreeing with the insults. A few of my friends defended me, but others just ignored it.

I reported the fake account and the comments to Facebook, taking screenshots for evidence. Despite blocking the anonymous account, they kept creating new ones just to continue harassing me. It felt like I was trapped, and no matter what I did, they wouldnâ€™t stop. Eventually, I decided to inform my family and a trusted teacher about the situation.

Received text from stdin: They started calling me names like bobo pangit and walang kwenta. They also made fun of my appearance by commenting Mukha kang ewan wag ka nang magpost.

The situation got worse when they started sending me direct messages. They said things like

Wala kang kwenta dapat di ka na nageexist
Lahat ng tao inis sayo feeling close ka masyado
Kahit anong gawin mo di ka naman papansinin ng iba
Some of their friends also joined in laughing at their comments and adding more hurtful words. One of them even edited my picture and spread it in a group chat adding insulting captions like Ang pangit niya guys tignan niyo hahahaha

I tried to ignore them but they kept tagging me in posts and making fun of me publicly. They also spread false rumors about me saying Nagpapansin lang yan para may magka crush sa kanya desperate masyado

This cyberbullying has affected me deeply I feel anxious and scared to post anything now and I am afraid that more people will believe the false accusations against me I am reporting this because I want this harassment to stop and for those responsible to be held accountable

After that I received multiple messages and comments from [name or username of the bully]. They started calling me names like bobo pangit and walang kwenta. They also made fun of my appearance by commenting Mukha kang ewan wag ka nang magpost.

The situation got worse when they started sending me direct messages. They said things like

Wala kang kwenta dapat di ka na nageexist
Lahat ng tao inis sayo feeling close ka masyado
Kahit anong gawin mo di ka naman papansinin ng iba
Some of their friends also joined in laughing at their comments and adding more hurtful words. One of them even edited my picture and spread it in a group chat adding insulting captions like Ang pangit niya guys tignan niyo hahahaha

I tried to ignore them but they kept tagging me in posts and making fun of me publicly. They also spread false rumors about me saying Nagpapansin lang yan para may magka crush sa kanya desperate masyado

This cyberbullying has affected me deeply I feel anxious and scared to post anything now and I am afraid that more people will believe the false accusations against me I am reporting this because I want this harassment to stop and for those responsible to be held accountable

Received text from stdin: I am reporting an incident of cyberbullying that I recently experienced. It started on [insert date] when I commented on a public post about [describe the topic]. Shortly after, a user named [name or username of the bully] replied with a rude comment:

"Ang bobo mo naman, wag ka na mag-comment kung wala kang alam!"
At first, I ignored it, but they continued to reply to my comments, mocking me and encouraging others to gang up on me. Their friends joined in and started saying:

"Grabe, nakakahiya ka naman, ang tanga mo."

"Wala kang alam, wag ka nang sumali sa usapan."
"Walang may gusto sayo dito, umalis ka na lang."
After that, they took a screenshot of my profile picture and made a meme out of it, posting it in a group chat where they added more people. Someone from the group sent me a message saying:

"Haha tignan mo yung ginawa namin sa picture mo, bagay sayo!"
"Hindi ka naman kawalan kung umalis ka na sa social media."

Received text from stdin: I am reporting an incident of cyberbullying that I recently experienced. It started on [insert date] when I commented on a public post about [describe the topic]. Shortly after, a user named [name or username of the bully] replied with a rude comment:

"Ang bobo mo naman, wag ka na mag-comment kung wala kang alam!"
At first, I ignored it, but they continued to reply to my comments, mocking me and encouraging others to gang up on me. Their friends joined in and started saying:

"Grabe, nakakahiya ka naman, ang tanga mo."

"Wala kang alam, wag ka nang sumali sa usapan."
"Walang may gusto sayo dito, umalis ka na lang."
After that, they took a screenshot of my profile picture and made a meme out of it, posting it in a group chat where they added more people. Someone from the group sent me a message saying:

"Haha tignan mo yung ginawa namin sa picture mo, bagay sayo!"
"Hindi ka naman kawalan kung umalis ka na sa social media."

After that I received multiple messages and comments from [name or username of the bully]. They started calling me names like bobo pangit and walang kwenta. They also made fun of my appearance by commenting Mukha kang ewan wag ka nang magpost.

The situation got worse when they started sending me direct messages. They said things like

Wala kang kwenta dapat di ka na nageexist.

Lahat ng tao inis sayo feeling close ka masyado
Kahit anong gawin mo di ka naman papansinin ng iba
Some of their friends also joined in laughing at their comments and adding more hurtful words. One of them even edited my picture and spread it in a group chat adding insulting captions like Ang pangit niya guys tignan niyo hahahaha

"Ang bobo mo naman, wag ka na mag-comment kung wala kang alam!"
At first, I ignored it, but they continued to reply to my comments, mocking me and encouraging others to gang up on me. Their friends joined in and started saying:

"Grabe, nakakahiya ka naman, ang tanga mo."

"Wala kang alam, wag ka nang sumali sa usapan."
"Walang may gusto sayo dito, umalis ka na lang."
After that, they took a screenshot of my profile picture and made a meme out of it, posting it in a group chat where they added more people. Someone from the group sent me a message saying:

"Haha tignan mo yung ginawa namin sa picture mo, bagay sayo!"
"Hindi ka naman kawalan kung umalis ka na sa social media."

"Ang bobo mo naman, wag ka na mag-comment kung wala kang alam!"
At first, I ignored it, but they continued to reply to my comments, mocking me and encouraging others to gang up on me. Their friends joined in and started saying:

"Grabe, nakakahiya ka naman, ang tanga mo."

"Wala kang alam, wag ka nang sumali sa usapan."

"Ang bobo mo naman, wag ka na mag-comment kung wala kang alam!"
At first, I ignored it, but they continued to reply to my comments, mocking me and encouraging others to gang up on me. Their friends joined in and started saying:

"Grabe, nakakahiya ka naman, ang tanga mo."

"Wala kang alam, wag ka nang sumali sa usapan."
"Walang may gusto sayo dito, umalis ka na lang."
After that, they took a screenshot of my profile picture and made a meme out of it, posting it in a group chat where they added more people. Someone from the group sent me a message saying:

"Haha tignan mo yung ginawa namin sa picture mo, bagay sayo!"
"Hindi ka naman kawalan kung umalis ka na sa social media."

After that I received multiple messages and comments from [name or username of the bully]. They started calling me names like bobo pangit and walang kwenta. They also made fun of my appearance by commenting Mukha kang ewan wag ka nang magpost.

The situation got worse when they started sending me direct messages. They said things like

Wala kang kwenta dapat di ka na nageexist.

Lahat ng tao inis sayo feeling close ka masyado

Some of their friends also joined in laughing at their comments and adding more hurtful words. One of them even edited my picture and spread it in a group chat adding insulting captions like Ang pangit niya guys tignan niyo hahahaha

After that I received multiple messages and comments from [name or username of the bully]. They started calling me names like bobo pangit and walang kwenta. They also made fun of my appearance by commenting Mukha kang ewan wag ka nang magpost.

The situation got worse when they started sending me direct messages. They said things like

Wala kang kwenta dapat di ka na nageexist.

Lahat ng tao inis sayo feeling close ka masyado
Kahit anong gawin mo di ka naman papansinin ng iba
Some of their friends also joined in laughing at their comments and adding more hurtful words. One of them even edited my picture and spread it in a group chat adding insulting captions like Ang pangit niya guys tignan niyo hahahaha

After that I received multiple messages and comments from [name or username of the bully]. They started calling me names like bobo pangit and walang kwenta. They also made fun of my appearance by commenting Mukha kang ewan wag ka nang magpost.

The situation got worse when they started sending me direct messages. They said things like

Wala kang kwenta dapat di ka na nageexist.

Lahat ng tao inis sayo feeling close ka masyado
Kahit anong gawin mo di ka naman papansinin ng iba
Some of their friends also joined in laughing at their comments and adding more hurtful words. One of them even edited my picture and spread it in a group chat adding insulting captions like Ang pangit niya guys tignan niyo hahahaha

At first, I ignored it, but they continued to reply to my comments, mocking me and encouraging others to gang up on me. Their friends joined in and started saying:

"Wala kang alam, wag ka nang sumali sa usapan."

After that I received multiple messages and comments from [name or username of the bully]. They started calling me names like bobo pangit and walang kwenta. They also made fun of my appearance by commenting Mukha kang ewan wag ka nang magpost.

The situation got worse when they started sending me direct messages. They said things like

Wala kang kwenta dapat di ka na nageexist.

Lahat ng tao inis sayo feeling close ka masyado
Kahit anong gawin mo di ka naman papansinin ng iba
Some of their friends also joined in laughing at their comments and adding more hurtful words. One of them even edited my picture and spread it in a group chat adding insulting captions like Ang pangit niya guys tignan niyo hahahaha

Received text from stdin: I am reporting an incident of cyberbullying that I personally experienced. It started on [insert date] when I posted [describe the post or comment you made]. After that I received multiple messages and comments from [name or username of the bully]. They started calling me names like bobo pangit and walang kwenta. They also made fun of my appearance by commenting Mukha kang ewan wag ka nang magpost.

The situation got worse when they started sending me direct messages. They said things like

Wala kang kwenta dapat di ka na nageexist.

Lahat ng tao inis sayo feeling close ka masyado
Kahit anong gawin mo di ka naman papansinin ng iba
Some of their friends also joined in laughing at their comments and adding more hurtful words. One of them even edited my picture and spread it in a group chat adding insulting captions like Ang pangit niya guys tignan niyo hahahaha

Received text from stdin: I am reporting an incident of cyberbullying that I recently experienced. It started on [insert date] when I commented on a public post about [describe the topic]. Shortly after, a user named [name or username of the bully] replied with a rude comment:

"Ang bobo mo naman, wag ka na mag-comment kung wala kang alam!"
At first, I ignored it, but they continued to reply to my comments, mocking me and encouraging others to gang up on me. Their friends joined in and started saying:

"Grabe, nakakahiya ka naman, ang tanga mo."

"Wala kang alam, wag ka nang sumali sa usapan."
"Walang may gusto sayo dito, umalis ka na lang."
After that, they took a screenshot of my profile picture and made a meme out of it, posting it in a group chat where they added more people. Someone from the group sent me a message saying:

"Haha tignan mo yung ginawa namin sa picture mo, bagay sayo!"
"Hindi ka naman kawalan kung umalis ka na sa social media."

"Ang bobo mo naman, wag ka na mag-comment kung wala kang alam!"
At first, I ignored it, but they continued to reply to my comments, mocking me and encouraging others to gang up on me. Their friends joined in and started saying:

"Grabe, nakakahiya ka naman, ang tanga mo."

"Wala kang alam, wag ka nang sumali sa usapan."
"Walang may gusto sayo dito, umalis ka na lang."
After that, they took a screenshot of my profile picture and made a meme out of it, posting it in a group chat where they added more people. Someone from the group sent me a message saying:

"Haha tignan mo yung ginawa namin sa picture mo, bagay sayo!"
"Hindi ka naman kawalan kung umalis ka na sa social media."

Received text from stdin: I am reporting an incident of cyberbullying that I recently experienced. It started on [insert date] when I commented on a public post about [describe the topic]. Shortly after, a user named [name or username of the bully] replied with a rude comment:

"Ang bobo mo naman, wag ka na mag-comment kung wala kang alam!"
At first, I ignored it, but they continued to reply to my comments, mocking me and encouraging others to gang up on me. Their friends joined in and started saying:

"Grabe, nakakahiya ka naman, ang tanga mo."

"Wala kang alam, wag ka nang sumali sa usapan."
"Walang may gusto sayo dito, umalis ka na lang."
After that, they took a screenshot of my profile picture and made a meme out of it, posting it in a group chat where they added more people. Someone from the group sent me a message saying:

"Haha tignan mo yung ginawa namin sa picture mo, bagay sayo!"
"Hindi ka naman kawalan kung umalis ka na sa social media."

After that I received multiple messages and comments from [name or username of the bully]. They started calling me names like bobo pangit and walang kwenta. They also made fun of my appearance by commenting Mukha kang ewan wag ka nang magpost.

The situation got worse when they started sending me direct messages. They said things like

Wala kang kwenta dapat di ka na nageexist.

Lahat ng tao inis sayo feeling close ka masyado
Kahit anong gawin mo di ka naman papansinin ng iba
Some of their friends also joined in laughing at their comments and adding more hurtful words. One of them even edited my picture and spread it in a group chat adding insulting captions like Ang pangit niya guys tignan niyo hahahaha

Received text from stdin: I am reporting an incident of cyberbullying that I personally experienced. It started on [insert date] when I posted [describe the post or comment you made]. After that I received multiple messages and comments from [name or username of the bully]. They started calling me names like bobo pangit and walang kwenta. They also made fun of my appearance by commenting Mukha kang ewan wag ka nang magpost.

The situation got worse when they started sending me direct messages. They said things like

Wala kang kwenta dapat di ka na nageexist.

Lahat ng tao inis sayo feeling close ka masyado
Kahit anong gawin mo di ka naman papansinin ng iba
Some of their friends also joined in laughing at their comments and adding more hurtful words. One of them even edited my picture and spread it in a group chat adding insulting captions like Ang pangit niya guys tignan niyo hahahaha

"Ang bobo mo naman, wag ka na mag-comment kung wala kang alam!"
At first, I ignored it, but they continued to reply to my comments, mocking me and encouraging others to gang up on me. Their friends joined in and started saying:

"Grabe, nakakahiya ka naman, ang tanga mo."

"Wala kang alam, wag ka nang sumali sa usapan."
"Walang may gusto sayo dito, umalis ka na lang."
After that, they took a screenshot of my profile picture and made a meme out of it, posting it in a group chat where they added more people. Someone from the group sent me a message saying:

"Haha tignan mo yung ginawa namin sa picture mo, bagay sayo!"
"Hindi ka naman kawalan kung umalis ka na sa social media."

After that I received multiple messages and comments from [name or username of the bully]. They started calling me names like bobo pangit and walang kwenta. They also made fun of my appearance by commenting Mukha kang ewan wag ka nang magpost.

The situation got worse when they started sending me direct messages. They said things like

Wala kang kwenta dapat di ka na nageexist.

Lahat ng tao inis sayo feeling close ka masyado
Kahit anong gawin mo di ka naman papansinin ng iba
Some of their friends also joined in laughing at their comments and adding more hurtful words. One of them even edited my picture and spread it in a group chat adding insulting captions like Ang pangit niya guys tignan niyo hahahaha

After that I received multiple messages and comments from [name or username of the bully]. They started calling me names like bobo pangit and walang kwenta. They also made fun of my appearance by commenting Mukha kang ewan wag ka nang magpost.

The situation got worse when they started sending me direct messages. They said things like

Wala kang kwenta dapat di ka na nageexist.

Lahat ng tao inis sayo feeling close ka masyado
Kahit anong gawin mo di ka naman papansinin ng iba
Some of their friends also joined in laughing at their comments and adding more hurtful words. One of them even edited my picture and spread it in a group chat adding insulting captions like Ang pangit niya guys tignan niyo hahahaha

"Ang bobo mo naman, wag ka na mag-comment kung wala kang alam!"
At first, I ignored it, but they continued to reply to my comments, mocking me and encouraging others to gang up on me. Their friends joined in and started saying:

"Grabe, nakakahiya ka naman, ang tanga mo."

"Wala kang alam, wag ka nang sumali sa usapan."
"Walang may gusto sayo dito, umalis ka na lang."
After that, they took a screenshot of my profile picture and made a meme out of it, posting it in a group chat where they added more people. Someone from the group sent me a message saying:

"Haha tignan mo yung ginawa namin sa picture mo, bagay sayo!"
"Hindi ka naman kawalan kung umalis ka na sa social media."

After that I received multiple messages and comments from [name or username of the bully]. They started calling me names like bobo pangit and walang kwenta. They also made fun of my appearance by commenting Mukha kang ewan wag ka nang magpost.

The situation got worse when they started sending me direct messages. They said things like

Wala kang kwenta dapat di ka na nageexist.

Lahat ng tao inis sayo feeling close ka masyado
Kahit anong gawin mo di ka naman papansinin ng iba
Some of their friends also joined in laughing at their comments and adding more hurtful words. One of them even edited my picture and spread it in a group chat adding insulting captions like Ang pangit niya guys tignan niyo hahahaha

After that I received multiple messages and comments from [name or username of the bully]. They started calling me names like bobo pangit and walang kwenta. They also made fun of my appearance by commenting Mukha kang ewan wag ka nang magpost.

The situation got worse when they started sending me direct messages. They said things like

Wala kang kwenta dapat di ka na nageexist.

Lahat ng tao inis sayo feeling close ka masyado
Kahit anong gawin mo di ka naman papansinin ng iba
Some of their friends also joined in laughing at their comments and adding more hurtful words. One of them even edited my picture and spread it in a group chat adding insulting captions like Ang pangit niya guys tignan niyo hahahaha

Received text from stdin: I am reporting an incident of cyberbullying that I personally experienced. It started on [insert date] when I posted [describe the post or comment you made]. After that I received multiple messages and comments from [name or username of the bully]. They started calling me names like bobo pangit and walang kwenta. They also made fun of my appearance by commenting Mukha kang ewan wag ka nang magpost.

The situation got worse when they started sending me direct messages. They said things like

Wala kang kwenta dapat di ka na nageexist.

Lahat ng tao inis sayo feeling close ka masyado
Kahit anong gawin mo di ka naman papansinin ng iba
Some of their friends also joined in laughing at their comments and adding more hurtful words. One of them even edited my picture and spread it in a group chat adding insulting captions like Ang pangit niya guys tignan niyo hahahaha

After that I received multiple messages and comments from [name or username of the bully]. They started calling me names like bobo pangit and walang kwenta. They also made fun of my appearance by commenting Mukha kang ewan wag ka nang magpost.

The situation got worse when they started sending me direct messages. They said things like

Wala kang kwenta dapat di ka na nageexist.

Lahat ng tao inis sayo feeling close ka masyado
Kahit anong gawin mo di ka naman papansinin ng iba
Some of their friends also joined in laughing at their comments and adding more hurtful words. One of them even edited my picture and spread it in a group chat adding insulting captions like Ang pangit niya guys tignan niyo hahahaha

Received text from stdin: I am reporting an incident of cyberbullying that I personally experienced. It started on [insert date] when I posted [describe the post or comment you made]. After that I received multiple messages and comments from [name or username of the bully]. They started calling me names like bobo pangit and walang kwenta. They also made fun of my appearance by commenting Mukha kang ewan wag ka nang magpost.

The situation got worse when they started sending me direct messages. They said things like

Wala kang kwenta dapat di ka na nageexist.

Lahat ng tao inis sayo feeling close ka masyado
Kahit anong gawin mo di ka naman papansinin ng iba
Some of their friends also joined in laughing at their comments and adding more hurtful words. One of them even edited my picture and spread it in a group chat adding insulting captions like Ang pangit niya guys tignan niyo hahahaha

"Ang bobo mo naman, wag ka na mag-comment kung wala kang alam!"
At first, I ignored it, but they continued to reply to my comments, mocking me and encouraging others to gang up on me. Their friends joined in and started saying:

"Grabe, nakakahiya ka naman, ang tanga mo."

"Wala kang alam, wag ka nang sumali sa usapan."
"Walang may gusto sayo dito, umalis ka na lang."
After that, they took a screenshot of my profile picture and made a meme out of it, posting it in a group chat where they added more people. Someone from the group sent me a message saying:

"Haha tignan mo yung ginawa namin sa picture mo, bagay sayo!"
"Hindi ka naman kawalan kung umalis ka na sa social media."

After that I received multiple messages and comments from [name or username of the bully]. They started calling me names like bobo pangit and walang kwenta. They also made fun of my appearance by commenting Mukha kang ewan wag ka nang magpost.

The situation got worse when they started sending me direct messages. They said things like

Wala kang kwenta dapat di ka na nageexist.

Lahat ng tao inis sayo feeling close ka masyado
Kahit anong gawin mo di ka naman papansinin ng iba
Some of their friends also joined in laughing at their comments and adding more hurtful words. One of them even edited my picture and spread it in a group chat adding insulting captions like Ang pangit niya guys tignan niyo hahahaha

"Ang bobo mo naman, wag ka na mag-comment kung wala kang alam!"
At first, I ignored it, but they continued to reply to my comments, mocking me and encouraging others to gang up on me. Their friends joined in and started saying:

"Grabe, nakakahiya ka naman, ang tanga mo."

"Wala kang alam, wag ka nang sumali sa usapan."
"Walang may gusto sayo dito, umalis ka na lang."
After that, they took a screenshot of my profile picture and made a meme out of it, posting it in a group chat where they added more people. Someone from the group sent me a message saying:

"Haha tignan mo yung ginawa namin sa picture mo, bagay sayo!"
"Hindi ka naman kawalan kung umalis ka na sa social media."

After that I received multiple messages and comments from [name or username of the bully]. They started calling me names like bobo pangit and walang kwenta. They also made fun of my appearance by commenting Mukha kang ewan wag ka nang magpost.

The situation got worse when they started sending me direct messages. They said things like

Wala kang kwenta dapat di ka na nageexist.

Lahat ng tao inis sayo feeling close ka masyado
Kahit anong gawin mo di ka naman papansinin ng iba
Some of their friends also joined in laughing at their comments and adding more hurtful words. One of them even edited my picture and spread it in a group chat adding insulting captions like Ang pangit niya guys tignan niyo hahahaha

Original text: I am reporting an incident of cyberbullying that I recently experienced. It started on [insert date] when I commented on a public post about [describe the topic]. Shortly after, a user named [name or username of the bully] replied with a rude comment:

"Ang bobo mo naman, wag ka na mag-comment kung wala kang alam!"
At first, I ignored it, but they continued to reply to my comments, mocking me and encouraging others to gang up on me. Their friends joined in and started saying:

"Grabe, nakakahiya ka naman, ang tanga mo."

"Wala kang alam, wag ka nang sumali sa usapan."
"Walang may gusto sayo dito, umalis ka na lang."
After that, they took a screenshot of my profile picture and made a meme out of it, posting it in a group chat where they added more people. Someone from the group sent me a message saying:

"Haha tignan mo yung ginawa namin sa picture mo, bagay sayo!"
"Hindi ka naman kawalan kung umalis ka na sa social media."

After that I received multiple messages and comments from [name or username of the bully]. They started calling me names like bobo pangit and walang kwenta. They also made fun of my appearance by commenting Mukha kang ewan wag ka nang magpost.

The situation got worse when they started sending me direct messages. They said things like

Wala kang kwenta dapat di ka na nageexist.

Lahat ng tao inis sayo feeling close ka masyado
Kahit anong gawin mo di ka naman papansinin ng iba
Some of their friends also joined in laughing at their comments and adding more hurtful words. One of them even edited my picture and spread it in a group chat adding insulting captions like Ang pangit niya guys tignan niyo hahahaha

After that I received multiple messages and comments from [name or username of the bully]. They started calling me names like bobo pangit and walang kwenta. They also made fun of my appearance by commenting Mukha kang ewan wag ka nang magpost.

The situation got worse when they started sending me direct messages. They said things like

Wala kang kwenta dapat di ka na nageexist.

Lahat ng tao inis sayo feeling close ka masyado

Some of their friends also joined in laughing at their comments and adding more hurtful words. One of them even edited my picture and spread it in a group chat adding insulting captions like Ang pangit niya guys tignan niyo hahahaha

Received text from stdin: I am reporting an incident of cyberbullying that I recently experienced. It started on [insert date] when I commented on a public post about [describe the topic]. Shortly after, a user named [name or username of the bully] replied with a rude comment:

"Ang bobo mo naman, wag ka na mag-comment kung wala kang alam!"
At first, I ignored it, but they continued to reply to my comments, mocking me and encouraging others to gang up on me. Their friends joined in and started saying:

"Grabe, nakakahiya ka naman, ang tanga mo."

"Wala kang alam, wag ka nang sumali sa usapan."
"Walang may gusto sayo dito, umalis ka na lang."
After that, they took a screenshot of my profile picture and made a meme out of it, posting it in a group chat where they added more people. Someone from the group sent me a message saying:

"Haha tignan mo yung ginawa namin sa picture mo, bagay sayo!"
"Hindi ka naman kawalan kung umalis ka na sa social media."

Received text from stdin: I am reporting an incident of cyberbullying that I personally experienced. It started on [insert date] when I posted [describe the post or comment you made]. After that I received multiple messages and comments from [name or username of the bully]. They started calling me names like bobo pangit and walang kwenta. They also made fun of my appearance by commenting Mukha kang ewan wag ka nang magpost.

The situation got worse when they started sending me direct messages. They said things like

Wala kang kwenta dapat di ka na nageexist.

Lahat ng tao inis sayo feeling close ka masyado
Kahit anong gawin mo di ka naman papansinin ng iba
Some of their friends also joined in laughing at their comments and adding more hurtful words. One of them even edited my picture and spread it in a group chat adding insulting captions like Ang pangit niya guys tignan niyo hahahaha

Received text from stdin: I am reporting an incident of cyberbullying that I recently experienced. It started on [insert date] when I commented on a public post about [describe the topic]. Shortly after, a user named [name or username of the bully] replied with a rude comment:

"Ang bobo mo naman, wag ka na mag-comment kung wala kang alam!"
At first, I ignored it, but they continued to reply to my comments, mocking me and encouraging others to gang up on me. Their friends joined in and started saying:

"Grabe, nakakahiya ka naman, ang tanga mo."

"Wala kang alam, wag ka nang sumali sa usapan."
"Walang may gusto sayo dito, umalis ka na lang."
After that, they took a screenshot of my profile picture and made a meme out of it, posting it in a group chat where they added more people. Someone from the group sent me a message saying:

"Haha tignan mo yung ginawa namin sa picture mo, bagay sayo!"
"Hindi ka naman kawalan kung umalis ka na sa social media."

After that I received multiple messages and comments from [name or username of the bully]. They started calling me names like bobo pangit and walang kwenta. They also made fun of my appearance by commenting Mukha kang ewan wag ka nang magpost.

The situation got worse when they started sending me direct messages. They said things like

Wala kang kwenta dapat di ka na nageexist.

Lahat ng tao inis sayo feeling close ka masyado
Kahit anong gawin mo di ka naman papansinin ng iba
Some of their friends also joined in laughing at their comments and adding more hurtful words. One of them even edited my picture and spread it in a group chat adding insulting captions like Ang pangit niya guys tignan niyo hahahaha

started receiving hateful messages
on Facebook Messenger from my
classmate, Mark Reyes. At first, he
was just making sarcastic remarks
about my recent class presentation,
saying:
"Ang bobo mo talaga mag-report,
sayang oras namin."
lignored it, thinking he was just
joking, but the messages continued.
After a few minutes, he sent another
message:
"Paano ka nakapasok sa school
natin? Wala kang ambag, hindi ka
marunong makisama. Mas okay
siguro kung mag-drop ka na lang."
Later that evening, I saw a Facebook
post from an anonymous account,
but I knew it was him because of the
way it was written. The post
contained a meme about someone
embarrassing themselves in class,
and the caption said:
"Yung may nagreport pero wala
namang alam! Sino na to? Clue:
Laging mukhang lutang HAHAHA."
Several of my classmates reacted
and commented with laughing
emojis, making me feel embarrassed
and isolated. Some even tagged me,
asking if the post was about me.

Original text: I am reporting an incident of cyberbullying that I personally experienced. It started on [insert date] when I posted [describe the post or comment you made]. After that I received multiple messages and comments from [name or username of the bully]. They started calling me names like bobo pangit and walang kwenta. They also made fun of my appearance by commenting Mukha kang ewan wag ka nang magpost.

The situation got worse when they started sending me direct messages. They said things like

Wala kang kwenta dapat di ka na nageexist.

Lahat ng tao inis sayo feeling close ka masyado
Kahit anong gawin mo di ka naman papansinin ng iba
Some of their friends also joined in laughing at their comments and adding more hurtful words. One of them even edited my picture and spread it in a group chat adding insulting captions like Ang pangit niya guys tignan niyo hahahaha
